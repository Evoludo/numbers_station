<h1>Tips For Newcomers</h1>
<h2>To Spy Number Stations</h2>
</center>


<h3>Introduction</h3>
So you want to listen to the spies? It's actually quite easy. There are a large number
of broadcasts each day. In fact, there's probably at least one going on right now!
The purpose of this document is to show you how easy it is to listen in to these
transmissions, and give you some tips and pointers, along with suggested frequencies
and broadcast times, to make it easy to pick up your first spy station.

<p>
<h3>Equipment Required</h3>
First, you'll need a suitable <b>Shortwave Radio</b>, since Spy Number Stations almost
exclusively transmit on shortwave frequencies. If you already have one, you're probably 
all set. The basic requirements are that it is a "general coverage" receiver, capable of
tuning between the allocated shortwave broadcast bands, to what are commonly known as the
<b>Utility Bands</b>. Most inexpensive shortwave radios are capable of this, except for
the very low end models. This is necessary because most Spy Number Stations transmit
outside of the broadcast bands, although often close to the edges of the bands.
<p>
If possible, the radio should be capable of <b>Single Sideband (SSB)</b> reception.
This is usually indicated by either the presence of <b>USB</b> and <b>LSB</b> modes,
or a <b>BFO (Beat Frequency Oscillator</b>. Many Spy Number Stations transmit in
sideband, and most others are often best received in sideband mode.
<p>
If possible, an outside antenna is always preferred for best shortwave reception. If
this isn't possible (due to apartment or townhouse rules, for example), an indoor
antenna can still be used. When I was living in an apartment, I made an effective
antenna by wrapping many turns of wire around a piece of PVC pipe, which I hung above
the window where a curtain rod would go. There are always possibilities.
<p>
<h3>Stalking Your Prey</h3>
In general, most Spy Number Station broadcasts start on the hour, with very few starting
at the half hour, or even quarter after or quarter till the hour. So the best time
to listen is starting just before the hour. Why just before? Many Spy Number Stations
will put their carrier on the air before the broadcast begins. Some have been known to
put a carrier on the air hours before a broadcast starts! So be suspicious of open
carriers, especially on or near hot number frequencies. 
<p>
Here in North America, the most commonly heard Spy Number Stations are probably the
<b>SS/YL/5FG</b> stations. 

<p>
A brief explanation about the naming nomenclature of
these stations. The general format is language/sex/group size. The <b>SS</b> means
Spanish, other possibilities are <b>EE</b> for English, or <b>GG</b> for German. Other
less frequently heard languages include Chinese, Russian, Czech, Polish, etc. I have
never heard (or even heard of) a Spy Number Station using French. Odd, isn't it?
<p>
The YL refers to the sex of the voice, <b>YL</b> is female (a ham radio term, meaning Young
Lady) and <b>OM</b> is male (another ham radio term, meaning Old Man). The <b>5FG</b>
means that the groups are transmitted in five figure words, that is a string of five
numbers. Other common formats include <b>4FG</b> for four numbers, and <b>3/2FG</b> 
which is a particular case of five figure words with a pause between the third and
fourth numbers. Some stations don't transmit numbers, but instead use <b>Phonetics</b>, 
which are words that stand for letters, such as Alpha for A, Bravo for B, etc.
<p>
Take a look at my <a href="http://www.spynumbers.com/numberTypes.html">description</a> of the various types of 
Spy Number Stations commonly heard.

<p>
Each broadcast usually starts with a preamble that is transmitted for a few minutes
before the message. This gives the intended receipient (and you!) time to tune in
the broadcast. This preamble usually contains the address of the recipient, as a 
number. After 
<p>
After this preamble, the length of the message to be sent is usually given as the
number of figures. Then the message begins. Some types of stations repeat each 
figure, others repeat the entire message after it is sent the first time. Most
stations then transmit a word to indicate that the transmission is over, such as
"final", used by many of the Spanish language stations.
<p>
<h3>Times To Listen</h3>
Fortunately, some Spy Number Stations have regular schedules. The SS/YL/5FG stations
are usually very good about this. Some, like the 
<A HREF="http://www.spynumbers.com/numberTypes.html#Poacher">Lincolnshire Poacher</a>, and the
<A HREF="http://www.spynumbers.com/numberTypes.html#Mossad">Mossad stations</a>, 
are almost always on the air, on one or more frequencies. Others,
such as the 
<A HREF="http://www.spynumbers.com/numberTypes.html#RussianMan">Russian Man</a>, 
are seldom on the same frequency twice, but instead hop around.
<p>
<p>
To be kept up to date with Spy Number Station transmissions, you may want to join
the <b>Spy Number Station Mailing List</b>. It goes out weekly, and contains
loggings and other information supplied by other subscribers. It's free, and you can

<h3>Cracking The Code</h3>
Can Spy Number Station messages be decoded by the listener? The answer is most probably
no. It is believed that a <b>One Time Pad</b> is used, which should make it impossible
for a message to be decoded. Here's a brief introduction into the world of cryptography,
along with some hypothesises as to how Spy Number Station messages are encoded.
<p>
<h4>Cryptography Basics</h4>
Say you have a message that you want to convey to someone else, and you want to encode
it so that no one else can read it. How can this be done? There are many methods that
have been used in the past.
<p>
One of the first methods
used a substitution of letters. It is believed that Caesar used this system. For
example, the letter A could be substituted by F, B by G, and so on. Or, a completely
random substitution system could be used. 
<p>
<pre>
Letter      Substitute                   Letter      Substitute
A           X                            N           C
B           L                            O           Z
C           K                            P           T
D           Q                            Q           F
E           D                            R           V
F           R                            S           G
G           N                            T           M
H           A                            U           U
I           W                            V           H
J           B                            W           O
K           Y                            X           J
L           E                            Y           P
M           S                            Z           I
</pre>
<p>

Unfortunately, this system quickly falls
prey to analysis. There are well known tables of the frequency of occurance of each
letter in the English language. Given a large enough amount of ciphertext, it would
be possible to determine at least some of the more commonly used letters. By examining
the partially decoded text, it would then be possible to make guesses at the other
letters, by looking at partially decoded words. 

<p>
<pre>
Frequency, expressed per 100 letters:
  13 9 8 8 7 7 7 6 6 4 4 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 1 1 1 - - - - -
   E T A O N I R S H L D C U P F M W Y B G V K Q X J Z
</pre>

<p>
A slightly more advanced system could change the substitution used throughout the
message by a known algorithm. Unfortunately this method can also be sucessfully
attacked, given enough ciphertext. With the computing power available today, any
such system could easily be broken, even using a personal computer.
<p>
Today there are encryption methods employed by computers, which make use of complex
encoding methods using large numbers as keys. These systems too can be broken, given
enough computing power. And the <A HREF="http://www.nsa.gov">National Security Agency</a>
is the world's largest buyer of supercomputers!
<p>
<h4>One Time Pads</h4>
One very secure method of encrypting a document is by the use of a <b>One Time Pad</b>.
The pad (which may actually more closely resemble a book due to it's size!) contains 
a listing of random numbers used to encrypt the text. A similar reverse pad is employed
by the recipient to decode the message. 
<p>
Example:
<p>
<pre>
Plaintext:   R   A   D   I   O   H   A   B   A   N   A   I   S   B   O   R   I   N   G
Equivilent: 18   1   4   9  15   8   1   2   1  14   1   9  19   2  15  18   9  14   7


Using the table of truly random numbers from the one time pad: 

    47693 94573 18483 59384 51839 47263 58347 21634 59347 73633 04732
    38483 63933 74342 03843 37549 45839 59843 94784 83744 28483 93843
    47539 72384 19383 94833 03484 58393 ...

Add the cipher equivalent to the random key: 

        R       A       D       I       O.....
       18       1       4       9      15
    47693   94573   18483   59384   51839
    -----   -----   -----   -----   -----
    47711   94574   18487   59393   51854


Transmit new cipher text: 

   47711  94574  18487  59393  51854.....
   
   
The recipient has a copy of the same pad, and uses the same set of random numbers to
decrypt the message (in this case subtracting the random number from the transmitted
number to produce the plaintext.
 
</pre>
<p>
As you can see, the secret is the use of a set of random numbers to encrypt the message.
Other encryption schemes can be broken because if an algorithm is used to encrypt the
message, it is possible to deduce that algorithm. With the one time pad, purely random
numbers are used. There's no algorithm to generate them, so there's nothing to break.
Of course, this assumes that truly random numbers are used. Sophisticated techniques
are available for producing random numbers, including the decay of radioisotopes. I
also understand that CDROMS are available which contain nothing but random numbers. The
random number generators in most personal computers do use rather poor algorithms 
which don't produce truly random numbers.
<p>

As the name implies, the secret is that the pad is only to be used once. This ensures
that enough ciphertext is not available to make use of statistical code breaking 
methods. And, should that code become compromised, no other messages are subject to
decryption. 
<p>
And as it turns out, the pads are actually physically quite small. Russian pads by
the 1960's were the size of postage stamps (read with a magnifying glass). Later 
they became microdots, requiring a microscope to read them. This made it possible to
hide them quite easily. The pad could literally be the period at the end of a 
sentence in a letter! This allowed the pads to be easily conveyed to agents in the
field.
<p>
As it turns out, one time pad systems have been broken. Perhaps the best publicized
case is the decoding of Soviet KGB and GRU messages during World War II by American
code breakers. Information about the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/docs/venona/venona.html">VENONA</a>
project is available on the <A HREF="http://www.nsa.gov">NSA</a> web page. Supposedly,
the Soviets broke the cardinal rule of one time pads, they used them more than once!
<p>
So, how do Spy Number Stations encode their messages. Due to the relatively short
messages (sometimes 20 or so groups) often heard, it is unlikely that individual 
letters are encoded. It is possible that each group represents a word, or perhaps
even some represent common phrases. Some groups could represent individual letters, 
for when it is necessary to spell out a name or location. It is also possible that
some common words or phrases can be represented by more than one group, this should
make attacks on the code much less sucessful. 
<p>
With a five digit code, 100,000 possible words or phrases could be encoded. A four 
digit code could encode 10,000 possible words or phrases. But that brings up an
interesting point. Just because the message is sent as blocks of four or five digit
numbers does not mean that is the actual entryption system used! It is quite possible
that they are transmitted that way to make it easier for the agent to copy the 
message. People deal with short numbers much better than long ones. The actual
encryption system could make use of six digit numbers, with 1,000,000 possibilities.
This would allow practically every word in the English language to be encoded.
<p>
Many descriptions of cryptography that I've read often display ciphertext in five
character/digit blocks, so this seems to be standard. That being the case, the 
fact that Spy Number Stations transmit messages in five (or sometimes four) digit
blocks probably has nothing to do with the actual size of each unit of ciphertext.
<p>

<h3>Drawing Some Conclusions</h3>
Even though it is extremely unlikely that a Spy Number Station message will ever
be sucessfully decoded, some interesting things can be deduced, or at least guessed
at.
<p>
It is quite likely that not all, in fact perhaps very few, of the messages transmitted
are actual messages to agents. For example, the <b>SS/YL/5</b> stations seem to
transmit two types of messages, those of a length of exactly 150 groups, and those 
with fewer (usually much fewer) groups. The 150 group messages are by far the most
common. They could be training exercises, or dummy messages, designed to confuse
the "other side's" cryptographic forces. 
<p>
It's also probable that many of the other messages are also false. It may be
desirable to trick the opposition into thinking that you have more agents than
actually exist. What better way than to send lots of messages to them?
<p>
Further backing up the belief that some of the transmissions of for training 
purposes are the observed broadcasting schedules. Transmissions from the NCS site in 
<a href="http://www.spynumbers.com/Remington.html">Remington, VA</a> have been observed in the 60 meter band
during the daytime. This frequency is much too low for propagation outside of
North America. These broadcasts may be used to train agents before they are sent
into the field. 
<p>
Some very curious observations may also be made:

<UL>

<LI>Why do so many of the world's intelligence agencies use basically the same 
method for communicating with their agents? We are led to believe that the Counting
Station broadcasts are by the CIA, that many of the SS/YL/5 broadcasts are from Cuba,
the Lincolnshire Poacher transmissions are from the British MI6 agency, and the
Russian Man is Russia's method of communicating with agents. Then there's the
New Star Chinese stations. Not to mention the
German number stations formerly used by East Germany (some of which still seem to be
on the air!). Israel is slightly different, the MOSSAD transmissions use phonetics,
rather than numbers. 

<LI>And here's a question I've yet to see answered - why no French
Spy Number Stations! Isn't that odd? And I don't believe that I've seen any reports
of Arabic stations either. 

<LI>Why are some frequencies hotbeds of Spy Number Station (and other bizzare
stations) activity? Take 6840 kHz. While it hasn't been as active recently, it used
to be <b>the</b> frequency for spooks. It had everything. And some strange stuff
still pops up there from time to time. 

<LI>Communism is dead. (At least according to the US government, Mainland China not
included). The Cold War is over. So why are Spy Number Stations still so active?

</UL>
<p>

Several recent books about spies that have been caught reveal that they often
received messages by copying numbers broadcast over shortwave radio. Sounds a lot
like the Spy Number Stations we know and love. Yet, no one from within the intelligence
community (of any nation) has revealed any information about these broadcasts, even
retired persons. It would be nice to get just a little confirmation about the
purposes of these broadcasts, even without compromising agents or national security. 

<p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
With all of today's advanced communication systems, why still use Spy Number Stations
to transmit messages to agents in the field? There are a number of reasons why this
may still be considered a valid method of communication. Foremost, there is no direct
link between the agent and the agency. No letter or package is mailed. No telephone
call is made. No modem or internet communication link can be established. Basically,
there's no evidence that someone received the message. This may be the most
compelling reason to continue using such a system. 
<p>
Second, it allows a large number of agents to be contacted at the same time. One 
broadcast can be received by all agents in a given area.
<p>
Finally, it may be the most suiable method to reach agents who live in remote parts
of the world, where modern communication facilities do not exist. Indeed, there are
still many parts of the US where an internet connection is not a local call!
<p>




<h3>Conclusion</h3>
I hope this brief introduction to Spy Number Stations has been useful, and provided
enough information for you to begin your journey into shortwave's "mysterious side".
